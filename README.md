Take a quick quiz to test your knowledge of basic JavaScript. 

Here's why:
* You don't want to hire applicants without testing for understanding of the basics.
* You can easily compare results of various applicants. 
* You can't afford to spend time trying to figure out if applicants are qualified without a quiz. 

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
